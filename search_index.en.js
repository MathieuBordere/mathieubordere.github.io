For comparison I decided it would be\ninteresting to find out how wc does it on my Fedora 42 workstation. Turns out\nwc just uses read but with a buffersize of 256KiB, a value that seems to be optimized for an\naverage\nsystem.\nMy attention immediately diverted to the actual implementation that uses AVX2\nwhen available, I've never really taken a closer look at SIMD instructions\nbefore and decided it was the right moment as the code didn't look daunting.\n\nThe algorithm is pretty simple. It first prepares a 256 bit buffer with 32 \\n values at L7,\nthen reads a chunk of data, and as long as there is data to read, it loads 256\nbits of the data at L21 and compares the data with the buffer of newlines using\n_mm256_cmpeq_epi8. This sets the corresponding bits of the matches buffer to all\n1's in case a data byte is a newline or all 0's in case it's not.\nTo count the number of lines, _mm256_movemask_epi8 creates a mask from the most significant bit of each\nbyte of the source vector and stores the result in the returned value, in short it transforms 11111111 (a newline match)\ninto 10000000, and leaves 00000000 alone. Now what remains is counting the\nnumber of set bits in the mask with __builtin_popcount.\nThat's it! The remainder is some accounting when there's leftover data that is\ntoo small to fit an AVX2 instruction. Now, that was a gentle introduction, wasn't it?\n","id":"https://letmetweakit.com/blog/simd/","title":"A gentle introduction to SIMD."},"https://letmetweakit.com/blog/simd2/":{"body":"In the previous blog post we briefly looked at the AVX2\nimplementation of wc -l in Coreutils.
